#### Formerly eBay Sold Price Scraper

This code is free for use and I encourage others to use it for their projects. If you do I would love to see how you
used it, shoot me an email or message if you're willing to share. Further, feel free to open up new issues for defects
or new features. I can't promise to get to all of them, but I can try.

Formerly this program would scrape eBay automatically and compile statistics. However, eBay has added CAPTCHAs to their
site which I will not attempt to break with proxies or automated solving. However, it is still very easy to get the XML
manually and then this program will read through the XML, get the item details, and compile statistics for you. The
steps are as follows:

    1. Search eBay for whatever you are searching for
    2. Make an XML folder in the same directory as this code
    3. Inside that folder save the XML. I found it easiest to use Firefox => View Page Source => Copy into NotePad++ => Save (file name does not matter)
    4. Run the script "run_manual_xml.py" where the parameter passed in has the same name as the folder

This program is built to scrape all sold item data from eBay for any particular item. It will save the data to an excel
file and create a scatter plot of the sold prices by date along with the median plot line and trendline. Further if you
enter in the MSRP, it will plot a line for that and the break even prices of scalpers (particularly relevant when this
was written during the PS5, Zen 3, and Xbox Series X launch).

Note: If you need to do commercial research, make actual business decisions, etc... off of eBay data, I *highly*
encourage you to use [eBay's TeraPeaks](https://www.ebay.com/sh/research) instead. It goes back further in time, has
more detail, is faster, and is officially supported, and as of mid-April, is free to use.

The code was used in a series of articles I wrote in late 2020 to early 2021:

# Install Instructions

* Create an Anaconda 3.8 python environment
* Install packages in environment.yml or requirements.txt

# How to Run

* By default the program is setup to allow for easy scraping of CPUs, GPUs, Consoles, and Motherboards
* There are a number of examples in run.py, see below for details on the main class and functions

## ebay_search Parameters

* query: str - The query you want to search on eBay, e.g. 'RTX 3080'
* e_vars: EbayVariables - An instance of EbayVariables class that gets passed into the function.
* query_exceptions: List - A list of exclusions to add to the query (e.g. ['pics', 'photos', 'paper']), these all get
  appended when eBay is searched
* msrp: float - The MSRP of the item, useful when plotting to get an idea of what the price should be normally
* min_price: float - The minimum price of the query you want to search on eBay for
* max_price: float - The maximum price of the query you want to search on eBay for

## EbayVariables Class Parameters

#### General Parameters

* run_cached: bool - default=False: If True does not get new data from eBay, just runs the plots/analysis on the saved
  xlsx files. Most useful if want to get the data then run the plots using a different min date (e.g. for all time and
  then after post-launch only)
* sleep_len: float - default=5: How long to wait between url calls. This is to prevent DoSing eBay's servers and having
  your connection killed

#### plotting Parameters

* show_plots: bool - default=False: Whether to display plots as the code runs, always saves to a directory regardless
* main_plot: bool - default=False: Whether to show the Sales Plot as the code runs, always saves to a directory
  regardless. If show_plots is False this is False
* profit_plot: bool - default=False: Whether to show the Cumulative Profit plot as the code runs, always saves to a
  directory regardless. If show_plots is False this is False
* trend_type: str - default='linear': What kind of Trendline to plot on the Sales Plot. Allowed values are "linear", "
  poly", "roll", or "none"
    * linear - Creates a Linear Regression trendline
    * poly - Creates a polynomial best fit line
    * roll - Creates a rolling average of the best fit line
    * none - Does not plot any trendline
* trend_param: List[int] - default=[14]
    * linear - This should be a list with a single value, e.g. [14], how many days in the future it should project the
      trendline. If 0 it will not project at all.
    * poly - This should be a list with two values, e.g. [2, 14]. The first parameter is the degree of the polynomial, the
      second how many days in the future to project. The degree should be >=1 and the days should be >=01
    * roll - This should be a list with a single value, e.g. [7]. This is how many days to use for the rolling average
    * none - Does not matter what is in this field.

#### Search Parameters

* sacat: int - default=0: Can filter down to a specific category on eBay (For example, video game consoles = 139971)

#### Rate Parameters

* tax_rate: float - default=0.0625 - The tax rate to use when calculating profits
* store_rate: float - default=0.04 - The rate to use for eBay stores when calculating profits
* non_store_rate: float - default=0.1 - The rate to use for non-stores when calculating profits

#### Data Scraping Parameters

* country: str - default='USA': Allows for searching of different countries, currently only supports 'USA' and 'UK'
* ccode: str - default='$': What currency code to use when making plots
* days_before: int - default=30: How far back in time to search listings. Ends the search at current date - days_before.
  Note: eBay only makes public data 90 days old so there's no point in making this greater than 90
* feedback: bool - default=False: Gets the seller feedback for each sold item. WARNING: This explodes run times as the
  code needs to call the url of every single item. In testing the 5950X extract with this false takes 8 seconds, with
  True it takes 40 minutes the first time. This is forced True if full_quantity is True as there is no extra work to get
  the feedback
* quantity_hist: bool - default=False: Gets the full sold history of a multi-item listing. WARNING: This explodes run
  times
* desc_ignore_list: List[str] - default=[]: If populated, will check the sub_description field on eBay for keywords and
  if they exist, set ignore=1.

#### Misc. Parameters

* extra_title_text: str - default='': Extra text to add to the file name and plot titles
* brand_list: List[str] - default=[]: If populated, will search for brands in the list in the title and populate a
  column with the brand found. This is case insensitive.
* model_list: List[str] - default=[]: If populated, will search for models in the list in the title and populate a
  column with the model found. This is case insensitive.

#### debugging parameters

* debug: bool - default=False: If True prints out values found as the program finds them
* verbose: bool - default=False: If True prints out a number of exception statements, useful for debugging code issues.
  If you encounter a problem with the code it is VERY helpful if you set this to True, rerun it, and attach the output

## FAQ

* This is awesome! But it takes forever to run, what can I do to make it faster?
    * There are a number of variables you can set to speed up the program

    1. query - Obviously make this as *specific* as possible
    2. query_exceptions - Any minus conditions (e.g. if you're searching for 3070s but don't want EVGA, add EVGA to
       query_exclusions to filter those out)
    3. min_msrp/max_msrp - Set the minimum and maximum prices you want the program to search between
    4. sacat - If you want to search an item, choose the most specific category on eBay. For example, if you want to
       search for 3080s they fall under:

    * All -> Computers/Tablets & Networking -> Computer Components & Parts -> Graphics/Video Cards
    * If you query on eBay and look at the url it looks like "https://www.ebay.com/sch/27386/i.html?_from=R40&_nkw=3080"
    * The sacat is the vbalue between /sch/#####/i.html, 27386 above

    5. quantity_hist - If you don't need to capture every single sale on eBay, and just need it mostly accurate, set
       quantity_hist=False. This value is when you want to go into a listing which has multiple sales and get all those
       sales. This requires more query calls to eBay and takes longer. *Most* sales are not multilistings so this normally
       will not result in a large difference, but it depends on each item
    6. feedback - If you don't care about getting the seller feedback, knowing if the seller is a store, the city, state,
       and country of the seller, this can be False. Note that if quantity_hist is True, this is value doesn't matter as
       getting to the sale history requires going to the item page which gets this info
    7. sleep_len - This is a sleep timer added to the code to reduce load on eBay's servers. If this is too low eBay will
       terminaate your connection. Also if too low eBay will start giving CAPTHCAs, but only on the multi listing sales
       history page. If you have quantity_hist = False this can definitely be set lower. However, it's also just polite to
       not have this too low.

The quantity_hist and feedback settings are the two which will most dramatically improve your run times, but they also
reduce the amount of data you get. All depends on what data you need or don't need.
